# Project Goals
* Develop a functional instrument cluster simulation using CAN communication.
* Create a .dbc file to define CAN messages.
* Generate signals from a MATLAB/Simulink simulation using the Vehicle Network Toolbox.
* Ensure the simulation allows for easy integration of additional signals in the future.
